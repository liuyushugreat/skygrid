"""COP solver — greedy + bounded local swaps (§5.2).

Outline of the algorithm (``solve`` method):

1. **Greedy initialization.**  Walk the DAG in topological order; place
   each op at the site minimizing :func:`CostModel.op_cost` given the
   already-fixed producer sites.  This is the *myopic* lower bound.
2. **Bounded local swaps.**  Repeatedly pick the op with the largest
   contribution to the critical-path cost and try reassigning it to any
   other site; accept a move if it reduces the total DAG cost by more
   than ``epsilon``.  We cap the number of swaps by ``max_swaps`` to
   bound the runtime at ``O(|V| · |S|)``.

The paper shows (Prop. 1) that this procedure returns a placement whose
cost is within ``(1 + ε)`` of the ILP optimum for DAGs whose single-site
cost gap is concave in batch size (which our NN + symbolic mix
satisfies).
