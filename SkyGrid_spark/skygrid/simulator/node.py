"""Compute-node models used by the discrete-event simulator.

Each node owns a FIFO work queue and a single "worker" that drains
``flops`` per second.  Batch parallelism on the cloud is modelled via a
sub-linear cost curve (``_batch_cost_ms``), so that ``batch_sweet``-sized
micro-batches run at near-peak efficiency and small batches underutilize
the GPU.  This is the standard batch efficiency model used in DNN
serving literature and is enough to reproduce the paper's trends.
