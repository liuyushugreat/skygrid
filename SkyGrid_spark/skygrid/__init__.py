"""SkyGrid — Spatio-Temporally Partitioned Edge-Cloud Runtime for
Hybrid Neural-Symbolic Reasoning Pipelines.

Three mechanisms (STP, COP, ABP) are exposed through a unified runtime
(`SkyGridRuntime`) and a discrete-event simulator (`Fabric`).  The public
API below is the only surface tests and scripts should import from.
