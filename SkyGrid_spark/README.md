# SkyGrid — Distributed Edge-Cloud Runtime for Neuro-Symbolic UAM Reasoning

SkyGrid is the **parallel/distributed runtime** evaluated in the
IEEE HPCC 2026 submission:

> *SkyGrid: A Distributed Edge-Cloud Runtime for Hardware-Aware
> Partitioning and Placement of Hybrid Neural-Symbolic Pipelines*

The module answers a single question that the rest of the platform
leaves open:

> *How do we schedule a hybrid neural + symbolic DAG over an edge-cloud
> fabric so that city-scale UAM telemetry stays near a 100 ms p99 SLO
> while reducing cross-edge traffic and remaining robust to degraded
> edge capacity?*

## At a glance

| Contribution | Role | Measurable effect (default config) |
|---|---|---|
| **STP** Spatio-Temporal Partitioning | Spatial grid + FM refinement bounded by $(1{+}\gamma)\bar n$ | Edge cut 0.680 -> **0.077** vs. LDG and cross-edge traffic **397.8 MB -> 173.9 MB** |
| **COP-H** Hardware-aware Operator Placement | Closed-form compute + transfer + state-tier + queueing cost, greedy + local swap | p99 latency **~100.5 ms -> 72.1 ms** vs. static placement |
| **ABP** Asynchronous Batched Pipeline | Micro-batching with bounded staleness + hysteretic backpressure per stage | Provides bounded overlap/backpressure; sync is also reported because it is faster at unsaturated M-load |

End-to-end, SkyGrid delivers:

- **p50 / p95 / p99 = 48.42 / 65.31 / 72.14 ms** at 13.94 K ops/s
  in the three-seed M-regime summary.
- **173.9 MB** of cross-edge traffic vs. **397.8 MB** for LDG+COP-H
  and **~1.68 GB** for static-placement baselines.
- **Partition reassignment cost is amortized**: 493 boundary-cell
  moves across the whole 60 s window.
- Deterministic and CPU-only: one seed reproduces every number.

## One-click reproduction

The artifact is pure Python + NumPy.  No GPU, no network, no API keys.

### 1. Install

```bash
cd modules/SkyGrid_spark
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -e .
```

### 2. Reproduce all paper results (~5–10 min on one CPU core)

```bash
# Main table (8 configurations): Table 2 of the paper
python scripts/run_experiment.py --config configs/default.yaml \
    --output outputs/metrics.json

# Three-seed aggregate for Table 2
python scripts/run_multiseed.py --config configs/default.yaml \

## Extending SkyGrid

* **New partitioner.**  Subclass `skygrid.partition.base.Partitioner`,
  register it in `skygrid.partition.__init__.PARTITIONERS`.  Add a
  row to `scripts/run_experiment.py` and re-run to compare against
  STP / LDG / hash / random.
* **New placer.**  Same idea under
  `skygrid.placement.{base,solver}`; the cost model is
  parameterized over four fabric numbers (TFLOPS, latency,
  bandwidth, jitter), so heterogeneous edges need no code changes.
* **New pipeline.**  Implement `PipelineRunner.step(event)` under
  `skygrid/pipeline/` — ABP and Sync are 150-line reference
  implementations you can use as templates.

## Reproducibility guarantee

Every number in the paper is generated by scripts under `scripts/`
from YAML configs under `configs/`.  Seeds are pinned in each config
(default `20260928`), and `SkyGridRuntime` emits `RunMetrics`
dataclasses that serialize to JSON verbatim, so reviewers can diff two
runs field-by-field.

**DAG join semantics (`dag.join`).**  By default (`first`, the
setting behind every reported number) an operator with several
parents is triggered when its *first* parent completes — an eager
join.  In the default DAG `rule_check` therefore starts on
`feat_extract`'s output and `risk_score`'s output is consumed
asynchronously, so `risk_score` loads the fabric but is off the
latency-critical path (Fig. 1 of the paper draws that edge dashed).
Setting `dag.join: all` enforces a strict AND-join; on the M regime it
raises p99 to 82.3 ms (SkyGrid), 84.5 ms (LDG+COP-H) and 117.5 ms
(LDG+static) at unchanged cross-edge traffic, as reported in the
paper's sensitivity paragraph.
